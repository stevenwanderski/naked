# Naked
Naked is a base Drupal 7 theme that attempts to remove the cruel markup that Drupal imposes on unsuspecting souls. This theme does a few things out of the box:

1. Removes all system CSS stylesheets. This lessens your battle with Drupal when creating your custom styles.
2. Includes templates that remove extraneous markup for such core elements as regions, blocks, pages.
3. Includes a `$main_menu` variable that contains the markup for main menu. This can be placed in any template (most likely page.tpl.php).

This theme is intended for site builders that want *none* of Drupal's standard styles and markup when using a fresh install.
